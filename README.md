## About this software

Written in 2010.

THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN TERMINATED.

## Features

With the use of commands, users can 
- assert geometry properties, calculate (supporting square root representation) on geometry subjects based on their coordinates. 
- define a new constructions.

Besides simple constructions of line, circle, intersection point, midpoint, etc. VGeoDrawer can do some advanced constructions of incircle, excircle, radical axis, ..., which may useful in dealing with more difficult mathematical problems.
